# File Indexing Performance Delays

**Date**: 2025-06-28  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Open  

## Issue
Significant delays (20+ seconds) between file creation/modification and search index availability.

## Evidence
- New file creation: `test_new_file.py` not searchable after 20+ seconds
- File modification: Changes tracked by stats but search lag observed
- File deletion: Not tested due to indexing delays

## Impact
- Poor real-time development experience
- File changes not immediately searchable
- Affects incremental indexing workflow

## Metrics
- File stats update: Near-immediate (407â†’408 file count)
- Search availability: 20+ second delay
- Task coordinator shows queued/completed tasks indicating processing

## Investigation Areas
- Embedding generation batching/throttling
- File watcher debouncing settings
- Database write performance
- Task queue processing optimization
