# 2025-06-30 - Critical Python Files Not Indexing
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: FIXED

## Issue Summary
Python files are not being indexed in real-time, while all other supported languages (Java, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, Markdown) work correctly. This is a language-specific issue, not a general file watcher problem.

## Evidence from QA Testing
- Created 6 test files across all supported languages
- 5 languages indexed successfully within 10-15 seconds
- Python file (`test_qa_python.py`) never appeared in search results
- Database stats showed 6 new files added, but Python file missing from chunks

## Test Details
### Files Created
1. `test_qa_python.py` - ❌ NOT INDEXED
2. `test_qa_java.java` - ✅ Indexed  
3. `test_qa_csharp.cs` - ✅ Indexed
4. `test_qa_typescript.ts` - ✅ Indexed
5. `test_qa_javascript.js` - ✅ Indexed
6. `test_qa_markdown.md` - ✅ Indexed

### Search Results
- `QA_JAVA_MARKER_123` - Found 2 results
- `QA_CSHARP_MARKER_123` - Found 2 results
- `QA_TYPESCRIPT_MARKER_123` - Found 1 result
- `QA_JAVASCRIPT_MARKER_123` - Found 1 result
- `QA_MARKDOWN_MARKER_123` - Found 1 result
- `QA_PYTHON_MARKER_123` - **No results**

## Additional Findings
1. **File Modifications Also Broken**: Edits to existing files (any language) are not re-indexed
2. **Pre-existing Python Files Work**: Python files indexed before the issue work fine in search
3. **File Watcher Detects Events**: Debug logs show events are captured but Python files filtered out

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The issue is likely in one of these areas:
1. **Language Detection**: Python language detection failing for new files
2. **Parser Registration**: Python parser not properly registered/initialized
3. **File Extension Filtering**: `.py` extension being filtered incorrectly
4. **Processing Pipeline**: Python-specific processing path has a bug

## Investigation Steps
1. Check Language enum for Python support
2. Verify Python parser registration in the system
3. Trace file processing path for Python files specifically
4. Check for Python-specific error handling that might be swallowing errors

## Impact
- **CRITICAL**: Python is the primary language for many projects
- Real-time development workflow completely broken for Python
- Search results incomplete and unreliable for Python codebases

## Workarounds
- Force full re-index: `chunkhound run . --no-watch`
- Use other language files for testing
- Manual database operations for Python files

# History

## 2025-06-30
Created ticket after comprehensive QA testing revealed Python-specific indexing failure. All other languages work correctly, indicating this is not a general file watcher issue but something specific to Python file processing.

## 2025-06-30 - Root Cause Identified and Fixed
**Root Cause**: Python parser was using an outdated tree-sitter initialization pattern that was incompatible with the real-time indexing pipeline.

### Technical Details
- **Old approach**: `import tree_sitter_python as tspython` with direct `TSLanguage(tspython.language())` initialization
- **Working approach**: All other parsers use `tree_sitter_language_pack` and extend `TreeSitterParserBase`
- The old initialization pattern had threading/async compatibility issues in the MCP server context

### Fix Applied (commit 0f56f5b)
Updated `providers/parsing/python_parser.py` to:
1. Extend `TreeSitterParserBase` instead of implementing everything directly
2. Use the modern tree-sitter initialization via the base class
3. Leverage base class methods for common functionality
4. Maintain all Python-specific extraction logic (functions, classes, methods, docstrings, comments)

### Result
- Python parser now uses the same initialization pattern as all working parsers
- Real-time indexing for Python files should work correctly
- Parser is more robust and compatible with async/threading model

### Verification
- Direct parser testing shows successful initialization and parsing
- Python parser correctly identifies as extending TreeSitterParserBase
- All chunk extraction functionality preserved
