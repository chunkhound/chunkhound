QA Test File - Unique Content for Search Validation
Created: 2025-06-13T15:30:46+03:00
Purpose: Testing semantic_search and regex_search tools

This file contains UNIQUE_SEARCH_MARKER_12345 for validation testing.

Content sections:
1. SEMANTIC_TEST_CONTENT: This section tests semantic search capabilities with natural language queries about code indexing and search functionality.

2. REGEX_TEST_PATTERN: Pattern_ABC_123_XYZ for regex validation testing.

3. MIXED_CONTENT_SECTION:
   - JavaScript-like syntax: function testSearch(query) { return results; }
   - Python-like syntax: def validate_search_results(): pass
   - SQL-like syntax: SELECT * FROM search_results WHERE relevance > 0.5;

4. TIMESTAMP_MARKER: 2025-06-13T15:30:46+03:00

5. SPECIAL_CHARACTERS: @#$%^&*()[]{}|;':\",./<>?

Test scenarios to validate:
- Semantic search should find this file when searching for "QA test validation"
- Regex search should find this file when searching for "UNIQUE_SEARCH_MARKER_\d+"
- Both tools should reflect changes after file modifications
- File should disappear from search results after deletion

End of unique test file content.
