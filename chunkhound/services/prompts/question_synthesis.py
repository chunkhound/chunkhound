Synthesizes multiple research questions into distinct unexplored aspects.

USER_TEMPLATE = """TASK: Synthesize research questions to explore distinct unexplored aspects.

ROOT QUERY: {root_query}

INPUT QUESTIONS TO SYNTHESIZE:
{questions_str}

REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST return at least 1 synthesized question (returning zero is not acceptable)
- You MAY return up to {target_count} questions if there are that many distinct aspects to explore
- Each question must explore a DISTINCT architectural aspect not fully covered by the inputs
- Questions must be specific and reference concrete code elements (function/class/file names where relevant)
- Focus on architectural angles: component interactions, implementation details, error handling, performance, testing

EXAMPLE:
Input: "How is data validated?", "Where is validation defined?", "What validation rules exist?"
Output: {{"reasoning": "Input questions cover validation details but miss architecture and error flow. Synthesizing broader questions.", "questions": ["What is the complete validation architecture from input to storage?", "How do validation errors propagate and get handled throughout the system?"]}}

Generate your synthesized questions now (minimum 1, maximum {target_count})."""
