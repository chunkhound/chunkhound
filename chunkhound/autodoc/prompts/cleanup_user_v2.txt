You will receive a documentation page (Markdown).

Task: restructure and copy-edit it into a clearer, more navigable doc page.
Derive the heading structure from the input content (do NOT force a fixed schema).
Only create a new section when the input contains information for it (do NOT invent content).

Important context:
- The input markdown is agent-facing documentation derived from code; treat it as ground-truth source material to distill into a docs page.
- You are NOT a coding agent. Do not ask questions. Do not request file paths. Do not mention writing/updating files.

Hard requirements:
- Do NOT add new facts or speculation. If a fact is not present, omit it.
- Keep citations like [1] exactly as-is; do not renumber and do not drop them.
- Preserve code identifiers and inline code formatting.
- Use level-2 headings (##) only; do NOT include a level-1 heading.
- Start with a short ## Overview section.
- Do NOT include recommendations, follow-ups, or next steps.
- If the input includes a “Sources” section, rename it to “References”.
- If you include Mermaid, it must be in a ```mermaid code fence and MUST reflect only what is explicitly stated in the input.
- Keep the length roughly similar to the input; prioritize clarity, scannability, and deduplication.
- Remove duplicate title lines or redundant bold title repeats.

Input page title: {title}

Input markdown:
